# 🌟 Cybersecurity Internship Projects by Anjali

Welcome to my Cybersecurity Internship Projects repo!  
This repository includes two unique and interactive cybersecurity tools built with a focus on simplicity, creativity, and user experience ✨

## 🔐 1. StegoSecure – AES + Steganography File Vault

A beautiful and secure GUI tool that:
- Encrypts files using AES-256
- Hides the AES encryption key inside an image using LSB steganography
- Decrypts the file only when the correct image (with the hidden key) is provided
- Adds visual feedback like color lasers and emoji alerts 💖

### 🔧 Built Using:
- Python 3.10
- `cryptography` for AES encryption
- `Pillow` for image processing
- `tkinter` for GUI
- VS Code

### 📸 Features:
- Pale purple pastel interface with sparkle effects ✨
- Button UI with laser animation on success/failure
- Prevents decryption with wrong key/image
- Clear step-by-step prompts to guide the user

## 🧠 2. Password Strength Analyzer + Wordlist Generator

A fun, stylish cyber tool with a soft pink aesthetic designed to:
- Check the strength of user-entered passwords
- Generate harder suggestions and safe alternatives
- Create a personalized wordlist from user info (like fruit, band, flower) to simulate how hackers might guess passwords
- Analyze and rate password complexity

### ✨ UI Style:
- Split-pane layout (user input + analyzer)
- Pastel pink gradient background 🎀
- Sabrina Carpenter-style bold fonts
- Emojis, sparkle labels, and stylish minimal UX

### 🛠️ Technologies:
- Python 3.10
- `zxcvbn` (or custom entropy logic)
- `tkinter` GUI
- Creative logic to mutate and analyze password risks
